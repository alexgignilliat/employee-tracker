# Employee-Tracker

## Description

This is an employee tracker app created using Node.js and MySQL. This was a huge learning experience, and while there are still a few things I'm working out, it's generally how I envisioned it. I went into this not knowing a ton about MySQL, and although I most definitely have a lot more to learn, I believe I now have a solid foundation to build upon.

## Installation

Clone to your local machine and open in your favorite code editor to check it out!

## Technologies Utilized

JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL

## Information, Important Notes, etc

I started building this application at a time when I was just getting my feet wet with MySQL and while I'm sure it could be written more elegantly, I'm really proud of how it turned out.

â€œRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up."  - Stephen Hawking
